### Research question: will a food hub improve food security in Loudon County and northern Virginia?
#### Factors
- Food pantry and food banks (geographic location; how many people do they serve? how much food do they distribute?​
- Food security status (SNAP, food stamp,…)​
- Demographics (income, education, race/ethnicity, urban/rural)​
- Food access (food retailers)

#### To-do
- clean food retailer data
- create an R shiny dashboard
- create our own food access index

### What is in the repository?
- `code` contains the R codes that produce visualizations and do the analysis
- `data` contains the datasets
